## Well hello there! Hi, I'm Atharv ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Atharv Naidu, a junior at UC Berkeley interested in Machine Learning and other forms of Computer Science.

ðŸ“– I'm currently studying at the University of California, Berkeley and will graduate in 2027 with a triple major in Computer Science, Applied Mathematics, & Statistics.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything really. I love Machine Learning and everything open source!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Swift, Javascript, more advanced Machine Learning, and anything I can get my hands on!

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him/his

âš¡ Fun fact: Although I might be young, I started coding from age 8 so I ended up becoming fluent in Python before I learned Scratch.
